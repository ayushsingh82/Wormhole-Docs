Solana is a high performance decentralized blockchain network built for mass adoption with low network fees( $0.00025 ) . It is utilized for a range of use cases, including De-fi, NFTs, payments, and gaming.
Here are the key features of Solana is :

| Feature                     | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Onchain Program Development | The ability to develop and deploy programs onchain. Users can interact with these programs permissionlessly, removing the need for middleman servers. |
| 400ms Slot Times            | Every transaction sent by users on Solana is confirmed in a block. With a target slot time of 400ms for each block, users do not have to wait.        |
| Low Fees                    | Fees on Solana are well known to be low. With a median fee of 0.00064 SOL per transaction, Solana enables building for users worldwide.               |
| High Throughput             | Scaling to thousands of transactions per second, Solana is built to scale with your application's user needs.                                         |

## What is Web3 ?

Web3 is more **open**, **transparent**, **next- generation** internet where individuals have greater control over their digital assets. It's designed to be more **decentralized**, **secure**, and **user-focused**.
Here are the some key aspects of Web3 :

1. **Decentralization**: Unlike Web 2.0 technology , where all the services relies on centralized servers , Web3 uses blockchain technology where we don't have any servers and data distributed and operates across a network of computers.

2. **Cryptocurrencies and Tokens**: Multiple Web3 protocols and introduces their native digital currencies and tokens such as SOL , ETH that can be used for various purposes within decentralized applications (dApps). These can represent assets, rights, or access to services.

3. **Smart Contracts**: It's an self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement / functions directly written into code. Smart contracts automatically enforce and execute agreements when predefined conditions are met.

4. **dApps (Decentralized Applications)**: Applications built over on blockchain networks that operate without having centralized authority. Examples include decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and NFT marketplaces and many more.

5. **Interoperability (Cross-Chain)**: Web3 promotes interoperability / cross-chanin transfers between different blockchain networks and platforms, allowing for seamless interaction and integration. Examples of Cross-Chains protocols are Wormhole, Axelar etc.
