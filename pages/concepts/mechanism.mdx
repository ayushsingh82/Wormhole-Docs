# Consensus mechanisms

## What is Consensus ?

Consensus in blockchain refers to the process by which nodes in a decentralized network agree on the state of the ledger, ensuring the integrity and security of the blockchain.

### Consensus Mechanism of Solana vs Ethereum

Blockchain technology relies on consensus mechanisms to validate transactions and secure the network. Different blockchains use various methods to achieve consensus, each with its own advantages and trade-offs. In this document, we compare the consensus mechanisms of Solana and Ethereum, two prominent blockchain platforms in the fiels of their distribution , speed and many more

| Feature                 | Solana                                        | Ethereum                                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Consensus Mechanism** | Proof of History (PoH) + Proof of Stake (PoS) | Proof of Stake (PoS) (Ethereum 2.0)        |
| **Block Time**          | 400 milliseconds                              | ~12 seconds (Ethereum 2.0)                 |
| **Finality**            | Instant                                       | ~6 minutes (2 epochs in Ethereum 2.0)      |
| **Scalability**         | High (up to 65,000 TPS)                       | Moderate (up to 100,000 TPS with sharding) |
| **Energy Efficiency**   | High (due to PoS)                             | High (since Ethereum 2.0 upgrade to PoS)   |
| **Key Innovations**     | Proof of History, Tower BFT, Gulf Stream      | Beacon Chain, Sharding, Rollups            |
| **Security**            | Robust with high validator participation      | Secure with robust validator incentives    |
| **Governance**          | Community and foundation-driven               | Community and foundation-driven            |
