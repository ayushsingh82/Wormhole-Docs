# Solana CLI Tool Kit

In this section, we will describe how to use the Solana command-line tools to create a wallet, to send and receive SOL tokens, and to participate in staking.

To interact with a Solana cluster, we will use its command-line interface, also known as the CLI. The CLI is not necessarily the easiest to use, but it provides the most direct, flexible, and secure access to your Solana accounts.

## Installation

To get started you journey in Development with Solana , you need to specify first whether you wish to go with client side development or Onchain development or both.

### **Cliend Side Development**

If you're developing on the client-side, you can work with any programming language you're comfortable with. Solana has community-contributed SDKs to help developers interact with the Solana network in most popular languages:

| Language       | SDK                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RUST**       | [`solana_sdk`](https://docs.rs/solana-sdk/latest/solana_sdk/)       |
| **Typescript** | [`@solana/web3.js`](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/)  |
| **Python**     | [`solders`](https://pypi.org/project/solders/)                      |
| **Java**       | [`solanaj`](https://github.com/skynetcapital/solanaj)               |
| **C++**        | [`solcpp`](https://github.com/aaomidi/solcpp)                       |
| **Go**         | [`solana-go`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gagliardetto/solana-go) |
| **Kotlin**     | [`solanaKT`](https://github.com/rock3r/solana-kt)                   |
| **Dart**       | [`solana`](https://pub.dev/packages/solana)                         |

Now after building client-side applications , we now require RPC to communicate with network. Solana have multiple
RPC Infrastructure :

| **Testnet**                                                      | **Devnet**                                                               | **Mainnet-beta**                                                           |

### **Onchain Program Development**

Onchain Program Development consists of writing programs / smart contracts in Rust , C, C++. Firstly you have to install Rust on your machine. You can do this by pasting the command in ur desired file/ terminal :

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

After it , you need to have [Solana CLI](https://solana.com/developers/guides/getstarted/setup-local-development) installed on your machine, I have attached the proper resources of it . You can install the Solana CLI by running the following command:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)"
```

After installation of both the above terminilogies , I suggest you to run Local validator to test and perfom onchain activities .

```sh
solana-test-validator
```

While building onchain , you need to choose between **Rust (without a framework) / Anchor Framework**. Anchor is a framework that makes it easier to build on Solana by providing a higher-level API for developers.
