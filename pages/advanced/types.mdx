Welcome and congratulations making so far developers , from now we are going to deep dive into the development on Solana and it's core fundamentals

# Types of Development on Solana

1. **Client Development** : Development where you interact / communicate directly onchain via writing software and building D-Apps (Decentralized Application) on it and can perform multiple transactions for actions onchains. You can write in any language.

2. **Onchain Program Development** : This is development where you can directly create , customized and deploy your program on chain. Here the difference is you can build programs in given languages i.e. Rust, C++ or C . Rust is one of the most popular and demanding language nowadays

The point to be notice between the Onchain and Client side interaction is **Solana JSON API**. This is very common is frontend and backend development , here client side sends RPC request to Solana network to perform multiple onchain activities. Here is the difference is backend technology which is in the form of Blockchain Networek (Solana Network)
